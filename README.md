## About me

I’m a **Computer Science student at CAU** focused on building backend systems centered around data processing, automation, and reliability.
I’m particularly interested in **production-grade systems** and in exploring how machine learning models can be integrated into real-world backend architectures, from data pipelines to reliable deployment.


## Skills

- **Languages**: Python, Java, C, C++  
- **Web / API**: FastAPI, Pydantic  
- **Databases / ORM**: PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy  
- **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions  
- **Testing**: Pytest  
- **Migrations**: Alembic  

## Focus

**Current deep focus:**  
- Production-quality backend architecture & automation  
- Reliable data ingestion, transformation & serving layers  
- Analytical schemas, aggregates & behavior insights  
- Batch pipelines & data quality automation  

**Long-term direction:**
- Infrastructure automation & reproducible deployments (Terraform, Docker, CI/CD)
- Scalable backend systems supporting ML workloads (FastAPI, async Python, PostgreSQL)
- End-to-end systems combining backend, data pipelines, and production deployment (Python, SQL, batch pipelines, containerized services)

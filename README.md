## About Me

I build reliable, production-grade systems and explore how to bring machine learning models into real-world production.  
Currently focused on backend development with async Python stacks, containerization, CI/CD, and early steps in recommendation systems.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, Java, C, C++  
- **Web / API**: FastAPI, Pydantic  
- **Databases / ORM**: PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy (async)  
- **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions  
- **Testing**: Pytest (with async clients and DB isolation)  
- **Migrations**: Alembic

**Current deep focus:**
- Production-quality backend architecture & automation
- Async Python, reliable testing, containerization
- First serious machine learning deployment experience

**My clear long-term direction:**
- Turn **ani-mind** into a complete ML recommendation system
- Master **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform)
- Learn real **Kubernetes** & GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux)
- Build serious **MLOps** expertise:
  - model versioning & tracking
  - production serving
  - monitoring, drift detection & automated retraining
- Create several **end-to-end portfolio projects**  
  (backend + ML + full production deployment & observability)

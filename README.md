## About me
I’m a **Computer Science student at CAU** focused on building backend systems centered around data processing, automation, and reliability.  
I’m particularly interested in production-grade systems and in exploring how machine learning models can be integrated into real-world backend architectures, from data pipelines to reliable deployment.

## Projects

- **[Fin-Pulse](https://github.com/ayzrixsiev/Fin-Pulse)**  
  A production-style personal finance data pipeline and insights platform, built to showcase data engineering capabilities. Using async Python with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, it ingests transaction data from CSVs or APIs, runs ETL orchestration for cleaning and categorization, models analytical schemas for fast querying, and serves aggregates like spending trends. Containerized with Docker for multi-service reliability, automated via GitHub Actions CI/CD, and tested with Pytest for data quality and isolation. This project demonstrates scalable data processing, batch pipelines, and backend automation in a real-world fintech context.

- **[ml-mastery-lab](https://github.com/ayzrixsiev/ml-mastery-lab)**  
  My dedicated space for mastering machine learning foundations, with detailed notes, code snippets, and experiments in linear algebra, statistics, and core ML concepts. Exploring vectors, matrices, determinants, and their applications in data representation and similarity metrics using NumPy and Matplotlib. This repo highlights my math skills for ML, including computations for eigenvalues and projections, building toward practical model implementation in scikit-learn.
